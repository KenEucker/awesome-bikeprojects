# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- **Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.**
- Use the following format: `[PACKAGE](LINK) - DESCRIPTION.`
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Don't include iOS versions or Swift versions in the description.
- Emojis should be used with care in descriptions, we already had some problems with emoji render in GitHub.
- End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure that your suggestion is positioned as the last item category.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
